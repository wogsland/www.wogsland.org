June 3rd, 2005 - Welcome to Wogsland.org! The purpose of Wogsland.org is to link our family together through the internet. As with any family, not everyone has the same lastname. Wogsland is obtuse enough that Wogsland.org is still available as a domain name, and it also happens to be the last name of the starter of this page. Nevertheless, this webpage is intended to link the whole family - which for the most part aren't Wogslands! 
<p>
At left you'll find links to the webpages of family members. If you've got a webpage and would like to be included in this list, <a href="mailto: bradley@wogsland.org">email me</a>. 
<p>
Also at left are some other family-style links. The only one with a lot of content right now is <a href="genealogy/index.html">Genealogy</a>. This links to genealogical work on the family compiled mainly from previous work by our ancestors, especially Neal Wogsland and Virginia Craig, which used to be on my homepage. Again, if you're not in there and you should be, <a href="mailto: bradley@wogsland.org">email me</a>. The other links, to <a href="articles/index.html">Articles</a>, <a href="memories/index.html">Memories</a> and <a href="recipes/index.html">Recipes</a> are for <i>YOU</i> to fill! Have you ever wanted to write an article about something? <a href="mailto: bradley@wogsland.org">Email it to me</a> and I'll put it up here for the rest of the family and the world to ponder. Do you have a great recipe you'd like to share? <a href="mailto: bradley@wogsland.org">Email it to me</a> and I'll put it up here for the rest of the family and the world to enjoy. The memories section is a chance for you to take part in recording family history. Genealogy is more than just dates and names, it's the story of our past. <a href="mailto: bradley@wogsland.org">Email me</a> your recollections of people or events that were important in <i>YOUR</i> life, and help write our history!<p>
