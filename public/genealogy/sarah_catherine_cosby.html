Sarah Catherine Cosby, or "Katie" as she is called, was born to Ned and Amy Cosby on the 4th of 
August in 1977.  Her dad was in the Coast Guard and then the ministry, so the family moved around 
quite a bit when she was young. She was a young teenager when her parents divorced. Thereafter she 
lived with her mother in Severna Park, MD.  Her mother remarried, and Katie got a younger stepsister, 
Lauren.  Soon thereafter Katie's best friend Natalie, who had problems in her own family, joined the 
family.
