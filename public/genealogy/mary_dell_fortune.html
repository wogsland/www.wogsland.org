Mary Dell Fortune was born in 1926 in Baltimore, MD - the second child of Robert and Mattie Fortune named for two of her aunts: Mary Bell Fortune, who died as an infant and Dell Fortune. In her youth, most people called her Dell.  At the tender young age of 5 she lost her father to tuberculosis and nearly died from it herself. Thereafter she looked up to her brother Bob as a father figure.  She trained as a nurse and worked for a time at the Church Home & Hospital in Baltimore until her children were born.
