Several trivial formatting/spelling errors:

section 5 "distributionsz" in the 1st paragraph ought not to have a "z"
section 7 "millions" - this plural is usually written in America without 
an "s" and appears thusly in this paper's abstract. 
fig 3. is too big and should be split up onto two pages
