Alora August Wogsland and her twin sister <a href="brittan_valhalla_wogsland.html">Brittan<a/> were born to Bradley and Cara Wogsland during the Fall of 1997 in Greenwood, South Carolina. Alora shares her middle name with Cara's dad, Ray. Alora lived in South Carolina for less than a year before moving to Georgia. The first home Alora remembers is an apartment on Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta, GA.

Alora next lived in Alpharetta, GA, in an apartment in the basement of her grandparent's house. There she attended Pre-K at Kids R Kids and Kindergarten at State Bridge Crossing Elementary School. She also learned to love jumping on her trampoline. Alora got a younger brother, <a href="maxwell_andric_xavier_wogsland.html">Maxwell</a>, in the summer of 2003. In August of 2004 she moved with her family to Knoxville, TN and started the first grade at Cedar Bluff Primary School. They started off in an apartment, but her parents soon bought the family a house. The house was in a different school district, so Alora's second semester of first grade was at Karns Elementary School. She also completed the second grade at Karns before moving with her family to Sunnyvale, CA in 2006.
