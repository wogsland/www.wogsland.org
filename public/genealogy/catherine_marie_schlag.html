Catherine learned to speak German as well as English, a tradition she passed on to her son somewhat diluted because of the anti-German sentiment resulting from the First World War. Catherine met <a href="frank_bush_marshall_sr.html">Frank Marshall</a> and wed him 22 October 1922 in Baltimore.

Catherine retired in 1970. Her grandchildren and great-granchildren called her "Grossmom", <i>groï¿½</i> being the German word for great. That is about all the German which was passed directly to these generations. (However, one of her great-grandchildren, <a href="1979/bradley_james_wogsland.html">Bradley</a>, is attempting to resurrect this bilingual tradition.) Catherine died February 18, 1983 in Baltimore, MD.
