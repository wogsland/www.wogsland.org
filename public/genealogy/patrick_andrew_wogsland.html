        Patrick Andrew Wogsland was a Valentine baby - the second born to Jim and Sally Wogsland.  He was born in Baltimore, MD. His elder brother was not old enough to pronounce the consonant combinations in his name when he was born, so he instead called him "Packie" - a nickname that has stuck with him. Packie's family moved around a lot, so he's also lived in  Pennsylvania, California, and Georgia.
