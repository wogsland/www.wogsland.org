<p>

Lars Olson was born in 1767 on the Vaagsland gaard in Tordal, Norway. He was a farmer. In 1790 he married Asborg Knutsdotter Tviet, with whom he had 10 children, although several failed to live past infancy. Unfortunately, he recieved an indebted farm from his father.  Eventually, Lars lost Oppistua gaard and moved to a smaller place on Vaagsland called Halsen. Asborg died the day after Christmas in 1815. In 1817 Lars married Inger Rasmusdatter Vraalstad Grave, who was 22 years his junior. Together they had a further 8 children, 4 of which survived to adulthood. Lars died in 1849.
