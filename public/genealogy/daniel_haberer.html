<p><a name="#nb"><b>Nota Bene:</b> Elsaﬂ is a mixed-language province on the border of France and Germany. When Daniel Haberer came to America, it was a part of France and called by it's French name, Alsace. At the end of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 it was annexed to the German Reich. At the end of World War I the French took it back. Hitler briefly made it a part of Germany again during World War II. Today Alsace, or Elsaﬂ as it's German inhabitants still call it, is home to Strasbourg, a capital city of the the European Union.
