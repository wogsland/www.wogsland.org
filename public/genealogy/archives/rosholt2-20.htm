			Mr. Rosholt was born Sept. 28, 1907, in Rosholt, a son of the late John Milton and Lillian (Anderson) Rosholt.
			He attended grade school and two years of high school in Rosholt, then graduated from Emerson High School in Stevens
			Point.<br>
			<br>
			He enrolled in Spokane College and later transferred to St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn.<br>
			<br>
			After graduation from St. Olaf he went to Shanghai, China, and worked as a journalist on The China Press.<br>
			<br>
			He was married to Margaret Njaa on March 26, 1933, in Northwood, N.D.<br>
			They settled in Shanghai and lived there for five years. They left China in 1937 and returned to the United States.<br>
			<br>
			He lectured for several years around the United States, finally moving to San Francisco in 1941, where he worked
			for the China News Service.<br>
			<br>
			In 1942 he was commissioned a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Corps and he returned to China where he was
			attached to the 14th Air Force during World War II. With his knowledge of China and the Chinese language, he served
			as a liaison officer in the field with the Chinese armies. He was discharged in December 1945 with the rank of
			major.<br>
			<br>
			After World War II he became an active member of the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force Association. For many
			years he was the editor of the Pictorial, the organization's newsletter.<br>
			<br>
			He and his family moved to Rosholt after World War II and he wrote books.<br>
			Several of his books deal with local history. The first was "Town 25 North" about the town of Alban and
			later "Our County; Our Story," a history of Portage County commissioned by the Portage County Board of
			Supervisors. "Nakkom: The Woman of Waupaca" was a novel based on a true incident in the area's history.<br>
			<br>
			He wrote "Trains of Wisconsin," "Wisconsin Logging Book," "Lumbermen on the Chippewa,
			A Photo Album of Marathon County 1850-1925," "Pioneers of the Pinery," "Florimond Bonduel"
			(written with John Gehl), "A Pioneer Churchman" and "From the Indian Land" (based on his translation
			of Helgeson's book "Fra Indianernes Lande" and his own research). The photos in the book were from the
			Iola Herald where he served as editor from 1965 to 1967.<br>
			<br>
			He maintained his interest in China and wrote books on his World War II experiences in China, the novel "Dog
			Sugar Eight," "Days of the Ching Pao" and "Flight in the China Airspace." More recently
			he wrote a biography of Madam Chiang Kai-shek entitled "China's First Lady."<br>
			<br>
			With his wife he edited "Chinese Fairy Tales" and "Letters Home from Shanghai." Together they
			wrote two children's books, "The Story of Old Abe" and "A Child of Two Mothers" and collaborated
			on "A Photo Album of the Past Vols. I &amp; II."<br>
			In 2004 he published his autobiography, "Rainbow Around the Moon."<br>
			<br>
			He was a member of American Legion Post 509 in Rosholt and the Portage County Historical Society.<br>
			<br>
			Survivors include one daughter, Renee Mei-fei (David) Elrick, Guelph, Ontario, Canada; one half-sister, Carole
			Nelson, Scottsdale, Ariz.; four grandsons; and five great-grandchildren.<br>
			<br>
			He was also preceded in death by one sister, Lola Rieke; two half-brothers, Emery and Alton Nelson; and one half-sister,
			Meredith Nelson.</font></td>
