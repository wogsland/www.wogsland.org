<p>


Mary Oletta Wogsland, daughter of Oscar and Catherine Wogsland, was born March 8th, 1931. Her middle name she took from her grandmother. Mary became a catholic nun - a Franciscan Sister, and hence never married or had children.  She taught French at the High School level until 1979 when she started teaching at <a href="http://www.sl.edu/" target=sl>Silver Lake College</a> in Manitowoc, WI.  Sister Mary had an interesting experience that got her started working on genealogy:
<p>
<i>Two retired teachers, Bjarne Wrolstad and his wife, came to audit my class.  The first day, I said to him, you can see that, by my name, although I teach French, I am not <U>French</u>! He had a twinkle in his eye and he told me he was from Iola </i>[WI]<i>, that he knew the Wogslands there and that his great-grandfather came from Norway with Ole Olson Wogsland - our great-grandfather.</i>
<p>
Mary recorded a great deal of information about her part of the family and disseminated it among the various individuals working on Wogsland genealogy.
