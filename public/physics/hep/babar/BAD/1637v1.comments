I read your BAD on the photon loss, and for the most part it looks very good. I just have a few nit-picky comments:

The time axis in figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 & 17 is nearly impossible to 
read.

What are the numbers that make up paragraph 2 on page 6? Did you intend for this to be a table?

Figs 13 & 14 are not mentioned in the text.

"though in the opposite sense of what one expect" after the bullets in your summary section 10 is not really clear. It would be better to just say the loss is lower for those tracks without a hit.
