Aslaug Torbjornsdotter was born on the Vraalstad gaard in Telemark, Norway around 1540. She married Jorgen Torvaldson and together they had at least one son. There is a record of her in Skein, where on March 3rd, 1564 she appealed a land deal her father had made before he died. In 1591 her husband was elected to pay homage to King Kristian IV in Oslo.
