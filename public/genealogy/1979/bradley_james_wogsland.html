          Bradley James Wogsland was born to Jim and Sally Wogsland in the humid summer of
          1979 in Baltimore, MD.  His brother
          <a href="../patrick_andrew_wogsland.html">Patrick</a> and his sister
          <a href="../jaime_beth_wogsland.html">Jaime</a> were also born there.  After that
          they lived in Pennsylvania, California, and Georgia. A precocious child, he
          endured a difficult youth. He attended three different elementary schools: Fern
          Hill (PA), Nielsen (CA), and Dolvin (GA). Thereafter he attend Taylor Road
          Middle School and Chattahoochee High school in Georgia.

          It was in a high school biology class in 1994 Brad met
          <a href="../cara_ellen_craig.html">Cara Craig</a>.  The security of their
          relationship freed him to excel in high school, taking college level courses and
          winning the science fair. After high school Brad married Cara August 10, 1997
          and soon after their twin daughters,  Alora and Brittan, were born.  They were
          born in South Carolina because Brad was studying at
          <a href="http://www.presby.edu" target=presby>Presbyterian College</a> at the
          time. After a year at Presbyterian, Brad realized he needed a more rigorous
          scientific education and transfered to
          <a href="http://www.gatech.edu" target=gatech>Georgia Tech</a>, where in 2002 he
          completed two BS degrees in Physics and Math. While there Bradley worked several
          odd jobs to make ends meet, including waiting tables and teaching for the Math
          and CS departments.

          In the spring of 2002, Bradley also moved his family out of their Georgia Tech
          campus apartment and into his parents basement. While far from being a perfect
          arrangement, this allowed the now school-aged twins to attend in Alpharetta
          rather than in downtown Atlanta. Maxwell, Bradley's first son, was born there
          in July of 2003. Brad's motto is "to learn all that is learnable" and he
          augments his scientific pursuits by studying history and languages among other
          things.  He graduated with a BA in German from
          <a href="http://www.gsu.edu" target=gsu>Georgia State University</a> in 2004.
          That August saw Bradley move his growing family to Knoxville, TN to begin work
          on his Physics Ph.D. at the
          <a href="http://www.utk.edu" target=ut>University of Tennessee</a>. In 2005 he
          became a member of the
          <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/BFROOT/" target=BaBar>BaBar Collaboration</a>,
          running one of the world's two B meson factories at the Stanford Linear
          Accelerator (<a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu" target=slac>SLAC</a>). That
          summer also saw the birth of his daughter Zara. Continuing the family's nomadic
          lifestyle Bradley moved them all out to California for the 06-07 school year to
          work at SLAC.

          After working at SLAC for a year, Bradley moved his family back to
          Tennessee and quit grad school to enter industry. In 2008 he joined
          Experian and moved the family to Lincoln, NE where they spent the next
          few years. It was there that he pushed Cara to complete her bachelor's
          degree in a science, and she chose biochemistry. Bradley's career
          didn't take off though, as the economic downturn hit Lincoln. He was
          in the last layoff before Experian closed the office there in 2010,
          but they remained in Lincoln another year so Cara could finish her
          degree. During that year Bradley helped Alora and Brittan prepare for
          the SATs, which led to them be recruited early college a couple years
          later. Cara getting into grad school at Vanderbilt led the family to
          move back to Tennessee, where Bradley got involved in startups. This
          put him on a career track he was able to advance on over the following
          years. In 2016 Bradley and Cara visited Europe for the first time and
          decided to move there. In 2017 when Cara had completed her PhD they
          made this dream a reality. Unfortunately, by this point there wasn't
          much left to their relationship, so they split up in 2018.
