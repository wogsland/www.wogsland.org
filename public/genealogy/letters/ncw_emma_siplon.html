<i>Neal kept rather volumous records of things, but some records he kept better than others. Most of these letters are from a file marked "INEZ STYZA and EMMA SIPLON" (they were sisters). Unfortunately, it appears that Neal neglected to make copies of the letters he sent her. The letters were transcribed/scanned in September 2005 by

Dear Cousin Neal
<p>
I was so sorry to hear about your father's death. I am just recovering from a long illness myself, so have sadly neglected writing any letters. You can be sure I would have written if I had been well. Ever since last June I have been suffering more or less daily from <u>Medicine Poisoning</u>. Since I am a heart patient I quite naturally have had medication <u>only</u> from a heart specialist. However I was also taking medication for Arthritis. This medicine has been discontinued since I first became ill. I am getting much better and I am hoping I will not suffer from this disease, or what ever it is, for a year like my doctor said some people do. This disease is very puzzling to me, since I never heard of it before I went to the hospital. However my daughter and her husband, Drs. Warren and Rosemary Wells both have known about it, as they both teach at Nothwestern University in the Medical Department. I feel very stupid as I also have a B.S. degree in Education from Wartburg College in Waverly Iowa. I also was a teacher for <u>over</u> twenty years until I retired.
<p>
The information you request about my family is <br>
My husband Joseph Jason Siplon (deceased)<br>
My son Joseph Byron Siplon (deceased)<br>

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year<br>
