<h1>Correspondence Conventions</h1>

<p>

<i>Italics</i> prefacing or postfacing the letter indicate explanatory comments I added.
<p>
Letters are presented in chronological order, even if they passed eachother in the mails. Undated letters are appended at the end of any correspondence.
<p>
Grammatical and spelling errors have been left to give the letters flavor, but words scribbled over or x-ed out with the typewritter are omitted. Doubtless I have also added typos.
