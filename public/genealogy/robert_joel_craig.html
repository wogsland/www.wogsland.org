Joel and Bev decided to live in Manassas and raise a family.  Together they had two daughters, Cara and Colleen - both Irish names because Joel was proud of his Irish heritage.  Unfortunately, Joel had diabetes, slowing withering him away as he watched his children grow.  Eventually, it took his life in 1985.
