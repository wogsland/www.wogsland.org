        <h1>Welcome to Wogsland.org!</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, and welcome to the website of the Wogsland family. This website
          was started in 1998 by
          <a href="http://bradley.wogsland.org">Bradley Wogsland</a> but was
          later added to by
          <a href="http://alora.wogsland.org">Alora Wogsland</a>.
          We have a pretty extensive
          <a href="http://wogsland.org/genealogy/index.html">genealogical record</a>
          of the Wogslands since moving to the USA from Norway. This website is
          currently run by Wogslands who moved back to Norway, but we try and
          keep track of all of our family. The names above are links to family
          websites, and the words are links to different parts of this site.
        </p>
