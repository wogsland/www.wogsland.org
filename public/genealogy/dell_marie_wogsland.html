The mid-1950's was a time of mirth: in Baltimore,  Dell Wogsland was born to Neal & Mary Dell Wogsland.  She grew up in the small town of Bel Air, MD. Dell was truly a "unique" child; always a cut-up. She attended Western Maryland College and graduated in 1976 with a BS in Psychology.  For a time she worked as an Investigator for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
