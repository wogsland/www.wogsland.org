<p>

Lars, son of Nottolf, was born in 1705 on Vaagsland gaard, Norway. He bought Vaagsland gaard back from Klaus Bugge with brother Olav and then split it with him.  After a short time, he took over Olav's part as well.  Then he bartered Olav's part to a Jorgen Jorgenson Boe, who later moved back to the Ettestad Gaard.  Also, he recieved a piece of the Snoas Gaard and a part of Vaagsland that had been traded.  Lars married Aslaug Simonsdatter Bergane.  Together they had seven children. Lars split up Vaagsland for his sons in 1759; to Nottolf, Nordistua gaard, and to Olav, Oppistua gaard. Lars died in 1777.
