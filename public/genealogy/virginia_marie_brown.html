Ginny has done an immense amount of genealogical work not only on her own family, but the Craigs as well.  Most of the pictures presented here for this part of the family are courtesy of her. When she finally retired, Ginny had taught for a total of 30 years at every grade level.  She enjoys spending time with her family, especially the Kings, who live nearby in Frederick. It has grown to include 5 grandkids and 4 great-grandkids
