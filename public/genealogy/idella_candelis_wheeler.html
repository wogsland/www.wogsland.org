<a name="#note"></a><B>Nota Bene:</B> In old American English, still found in the Eastern Mountains and Massachusetts, a final "a" is pronounced like "ar". Anyone who's been to a meeting where the "agendar" was discussed or heard North Georgians talk about "Atlantar" knows that this dialect pronunciation lives on today.<br>
