<h1>A Brief History of Particle Physics</h1>

<font color=red>under construction - this page is best viewed from a location with access to journals such as <i>Physical Review</i>, <i>Science</i>, <i>Nature</i>, etc. as there are copious links to the original papers.</font><p>

The earliest part of this history is probably familiar to most from high school chemistry class, nevertheless, it is included here for completeness.
<p>
1895 - Roentgen discovers x-rays<br>
1897 - J. J. Thompson discovers electrons<br>
1909 - Rutherford scatters alpha particles off gold foil to demonstrate atoms have nuclei<br>
1920 - Rutherford postulates the existance of the neutron to explain isotopes<br>
1927 - Quantum Mechanics reaches maturity<br>
1930 - Pauli postulates the existance of the neutrino to preserve the conservation of energy in beta decay (Bohr favors dumping the conservation of energy; fortunately Pauli turns out to be right)<br>
1932 - Chadwick proves the existance of the neutron (<i>Nature</i> <b>129</b>, 312 (1932))<br>
1932 - Carl Anderson discovers the first antiparticle, the positron, vindicating Dirac's theory of the electron (<a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v43/i6/p491_1"><i>Phys. Rev</i> <b>43</b>, 491 (1933)</a>)<br>
<p>
This is the part where most people's historical knowledge ends. Not coincidentally, it is at this point that story also starts to get very messy and stays so until the Standard Model is completely formed almost 50 years later. 
<p>
In the early days particle physicists had only one source to probe matter with, naturally occuring radiation discovered by the Curies in the form of alpha, beta and gamma particles (later realized to be helium nuclei, electrons and photons respectively). All the early experiments used radioactive sources until the discovery of cosmic rays by ? in 1912. The theory at the time was that all the radiation at the earth's surface was caused by the radioactive decay of elements within the earth. To test this, ? went up in a hot air balloon with a Geiger counter(?) and found that the level of radiation increased with altitude. The atmosphere filters out most cosmic rays, so there are more at higher altitudes. Carl Anderson used a cloud chamber pointed upward to study these cosmic rays and it was in these rays that he discovered the first positron.

1934 - <a href="cherenkov_detectors.html">Cherenkov effect</a> discovered<br>
1935 - Yukawa postulates theory of nuclear forces<br>
1936 - Breit-Wigner resonance formula developed<br>

<p>
<b>1937 - Discovery of mesons in cosmic rays:</b> <br>
S. H. Neddermeyer and C. D. Anderson, <a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v51/i10/p884_1"><i>Phys. Rev.</I> <b>51</b>, 884 (1937)</a>.<br>
J. C. Street and E. C. Stevenson, <a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v52/i9/p1003_1"><i>Phys. Rev.</I> <b>52</b>, 1003 (1937)</a>.<br>

<p>
1940 - Spin-Statistics theorem<br>

<P>
<b>1943 - Discovery of first strange particles in cosmic rays:</b><br>
L. LePrince et M. L'héritier, <i>Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci. de Paris</i>, 618 (1944).

<p>
1945 - Two atomic bombs detonated against Japan<br>
1946 - The meson hypothesized to be two particles (pions and muons)<br>
1947 - pions conclusively obeserved in cosmic rays<br>
<p>
Ih the early 1950's particle accelerators began to supercede cosmic rays as a major source of particles for study. The first cyclotron had been constructed in 1931.
<p>
Discovery of the first strange baryon was made by the Cosmotron at Brookhaven National Lab (<a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v93/i4/p861_1">W. B. Fowler <i>et al</i>, <i>Phys. Rev.</I> <b>93</b>, 861 (1954)</a>.)<br>

<p>
CP violation was first observed by Christenson et al in the neutral Kaon system (<a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v13/i4/p138_1"><i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</I> <b>13</b>, 138 (1964)</a>).
<p>

<p>
1974 - J/Psi resonance discovered<br>
1977 - Upsilon resonance discovered (<a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v39/i5/p252_1">S. W. Herb <i>et al</i>, <i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</I> <b>39</b>, 252 (1977)</a>.)<br>
1983 - Weak bosons (Z0, W+, and W-) discovered<br>
1990 - Number of neutrino flavors measured as 3 from Z0 width<br>
1995 - Top quark discovered at Fermilab<br>
