Jewelie,
<p>
So you are my 4th cousin. Mabel's father was Ole Martin Wogsland, who was the
brother of Carl Oscar Wogsland, my great great grandfather. My grandfather had
information (just names - mispelled) down to your mother, but no further. Yes,
I would love to add information about your part of the family to wogsland.org.
Firstoff, could you tell the full names and birth/death dates of your mother,
grandmother and great grandmother. I have no dates on this part of the family,
but here are the names I know from my grandfather's files:
<p>
Elra & Mabel Glenn's children: Bonnie Jean, Mary Ellen, Raymond, Roy, Eunice,
Kristine, & Connie
<p>
Minton & Mary Ellen Gratias' children: Lonnie & Carmen
<p>
That is all the information I have. Whatever you can add in terms of dates and
full names would be great. As you probably know from looking at my website, I
am interested in more than just that though. I would like to record the
stories of those people's lives. I would also like any pictures you can send.
Genealogy is, of course, a massive undertaking, so I will understand if you
don't have time for all that. If nothing else, start with yourself and work
your way back.
<p>
Looking forward to hearing from you,
<p>
Brad

Brad,<br>
I am glad to have connected
here is some info in no particular order:
<p>
I believe that Christine (mabel and elra's child) died as a child,
perhaps even as a baby, I can't remember. Roy and Ray were twins. I
believe all of the siblings have passed.
My maternal grandmother Mary Ellen Glenn married Virgil Gratias sometime
around 1942. I've never heard the names Minton or Lonnie. Who are they
supposed to be?<br>
I know a lot about Mary we were very close, she died in 1992 or 1993. I
have many pictures of her and her siblings and children.
Her husband when she had Butch was named Luthner, I don't know his first
name.<br>
She was married perhaps more times than we know and Virgil came to their
marriage with several children. Kenneth Gratias, Beverly Hewitt, Karen
Hilde and Arlys Bradseric. Ken and Bev are still living and I believe
they are both in Washington state.<br>
Mary had a son Larry "Butch" from a previous marriage, he is still
living in Washington and married to Nancy Gratias since the early 70's,
I was the flower girl, must've been 1974. I can ask them if you'd like.
He has 4 step children with her.<br>
My mother Carmen Anita Gratias was born January 12, 1946 in Spooner
Wisconsin at home in a tarpaper shack. She died in St Helens Hospital
Chehalis Washington May 22, 1981 of cancer. She died named Carmen
Gleason. Buried in the Napavine cemetery as are lots of our people.
She married Benny Gilbert Andrew Alvin Randall (my dad) in 1965 I think.
My brother Larry-Lawrence Lewis Randall was born April 16, 1967, I was
born 2-27-69.<br>
Benny "Ben" was born Christmas day 1940. He's been married 3 times and
has 4 step children.
<p>
Mabel Wogsland<br>
born in Tomahawk Wisconsin May 3, 1889 or 1899<br>
died Sacramento California April 5, 1959
<p>
Elra Glenn<br>
born in Tomahawk as well, Feb 8, 1897<br>
died Joliet Illinois September 4, 1969
<p>
I am particularly interested in my ancestress named below, Oletta Solum
Wogsland.<br>
Based on the info on your website Ole Martin Wogsland married "Norwegian
immigrant Oletta Christina Solum, widow of a fellow named Iverson with
whom she had a daughter, Lilly. Together Ole and Oletta had nine children"
<p>
Oletta WOGSLAND      *Birth Date:* 21 Mar 1875      *Death Date:* May
1963      *Social Security Number:*  397-03-1643      *State or
Territory Where Number Was Issued:*  Wisconsin       *Actual Death
Residence:*  Wisconsin<br>
She lived 88 years and had her 1st child with Ole at 18. I wonder about
the fellow Iverson.
<p>
 From our oral history I know that Oletta came to the US from Oslo all
by herself when she was 13 years old. I wonder about the years between.
If you have any leads I would love to hear.
I understand she remained in the Lutheran Church In Wisconsin (Tomahwk
area) till she was very old. I had a clipping from a 1958 paper but I
can't find it anymore, I'll keep looking.
<p>
The name my Grandma has in her book for Lilly, Mabels daughter is Lilliy
Sparks.<br>
The other last names for those Children are Gena Brum and Inez and
Margaret both are listed as Styza, I wonder if they married brothers.
The next section down, I imagine it is the next generation are the first
names: Elsie, Kate, Elra, Hanford and another seperate section: Joe,
Felix, Edward.<br>
The page is marked: Mom's family
<p>
I have a wedding photo of Mabel and Elra but I'm not sure I want to
remove it from the frame to get a better picture. For now I will send a
crude version of it in the frame.
<p>
below is weird obsessesive info gathered online that may or may not make
sense:
<p>
 Julius Solum
<p>
 Born:        1875
<p>
First Name: Nils<br>
Middle Name: Henrik<br>
Last Name: Solum<br>
Suffix:
<p>
RePEc Short-ID: pso27
<p>
Email: nils.solum@step.no <mailto:nils.solum@step.no><br>
Homepage: http://www.step.no
<P>
ANDREW E. SOLUM (SIGDAL)Mr. Solum was born in Sigdal, Norway, April 23, 1875, son of Erik Kristopherson Solum and Aase Andersdatter Aasgaard.
<p>
  What does the Solum name mean? Last Name: Solum
<p>
   1. Norwegian: habitational name from any of ten or more farmsteads,
      mostly in southeastern Norway, named in Old Norse as
      /S�lheimr/Solheim <javascript:GetSName('Solheim')>). (see
<p>
WOGSLAND  Mattie  23 Feb 1874  02 Aug 1903  Gone But Not Forgotten" -<br>
Wife of Carl  WOGSLAND  Edna I  04 May 1902  03 Mar 1903
<p>
 The name Ezra Galusha died in Canada 1965 is written in the book, I
have no idea who this is, do you?
<p>
What possessed you to take on this enormous task?<br>
I am so fascinated by it all and appreciate your work.<br>
<p>
I'll stop now, I know I have more info but I don't want to overwhelm any
more than I already have.<br>
I hope I at least answered your questions.

<hr>
Jewelie,
<p>
I've updated the webpage with this info.
<P>
A few questions:<br>
1. What is the meaning/genesis of the name Sweetwater?<br>
2. Do you have a middle name?
<p>
My grandfather's correspondence with Inez Styza (Oletta's daughter) should be
up on the webpage in a few days. Unfortunately Inez was more interested in
recording descendents than tracking down ancestors, although the information
about Oletta being married to Iverson first comes from one of these letters,
so being from her daughter I would consider that fairly ironclad (I attached
the letter in question).

Brad,
<p>
After reading the letters from Inez I see how confusing this must be to
transcribe. On the pages that are together it's arranged very oddly. I
think where she wrote "lonnie" for Mary Glenns son is that her old
fashioned penmanship is misleading I would have read it that way as
well, I believe she was writing "larrie" which is what he was called as
a boy. Notice the R in carmen below as well. Also the birthdate is correct.
<P>
Is Inez still living? I searched online and in Milwaukee WI there is a
listing for a Jack Styza which could be Inezs' son.<BR>
*Styza* Jack R<BR>
<http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&hs=850&lr=&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&q=styza&near=Milwaukee,+WI&sa=X&oi=locald&radius=0.0&latlng=43038889,-87906389,13805684018218457862><BR>
- 7.6 miles SW - 9050 W Waterford sq S, Milwaukee, 53228 - (414)<BR>
541-2888  What is the etiquette for contact?<BR>
There must be someone alive who knows Olettas maiden name and more of
her story...
<P>
My middle name is Ellen after my maternal grandmother.<BR>
The name Sweetwater was chosen because we couldn't decide which name to
give them, it just came to us. In the same way their first and middle
names came, it was actually easier than that.
<P>
My daughter has informed me that in the 7th grade (which she is
entering) there is a required genealogy project. Cool.
<P>
Thanks for all the correspondence.<BR>

Hey there,<br>
I have found an interesting bit of writings online that I am curious about<br>
http://members.shaw.ca/mekee%20%20/charts.html<br>
and does this:<br>
Hallvard on Vr�lstad who died before 1341<br>
(from the link above)<br>
mean that Hallvard was a worker of/on vralstad not a family member/owner
I am confused by the information, will you check it out and give me your
take on it?
<p>
another thing I am trying to bring to clarity;<br>
http://wogsland.org/genealogy/torbjorn_hallvardson_vraalstad.html<br>
so this guy was born on Vraalstd gaard in 1510 and his father had
Sandvik gaard given to him by his father in 1515 and so does that end
the name of vralstd and if so why doesn't the sandvik name now belong to
them?<br>
or does it?
<p>
and another link:<br>
http://www.wrolstad.com/<br>
these people seem to be of a place not of "our" family, what do you think?
<p>
This is a link to coordinates of vralstad:<br>
 http://www.fallingrain.com/world/NO/17/Vralstad.html<br>
maybe this is boring to you, but I thought it might be interesting to
you as well.
<p>
http://www.sandvikgard.com/<br>
and wouldn't this be a nice place to have roots to?<br>
http://www.sandviksgard.se/en/vagbeskrivning.asp<br>

it looks to me as if our families became linked around 1600 and her tree
goes back a little farther.<br>
http://wogsland.org/genealogy/torbjorn_jorgenson.html<br>
a little more info from the anderson family site, about tobjorn (above)
*Liv Anundsdatter* b. 1588 Holtan, Sauherad, Telemark NOR.
Sigrid Bjornsdatter  ma(1) b/4 1612,
does this mean married before 1612? if she was born in 1612 as I thought
at first there would be a huge age difference
answer to this below
<p>
http://wogsland.org/genealogy/liv_torbjornsdotter.html<br>
this page is not available any more
but the info on the other site is:<br>
*LivTorbj�rnsdatter of Vr�lstad* b. abt 1618 Vr�lstad, Drangedal,

Hi Jewelie,
<p>
How did your camp go? We just moved across the country to CA, so I have
a good excuse for my slow response.
<p>
> http://members.shaw.ca/mekee%20%20/charts.html
<p>
This is really cryptic chart, but the site seems to be really well
researched. I do not have the time to go through it all now but their
information seems to be based entirely on primary sources - my sources
are all secondary from the 19th and 20th centuries brought together by
Melvin Voxland, but supposedly compiled from contemporary church
records. See
<p>
Wogsland.org/genealogy/letters/ncw_melvin_voxland.html
<p>
I really need to digitize his book so you can see all the info, but this
site on Hallvard seems much better researched.
<p>

<p>
Norwegian nomenclature back then was very different from now. Usually
just two names were used, like I would be Bradley Jamesson because my
dad is named James. Likewise, my daughter would be Alora Bradleysdatter.
The other name like Vraalstad or Vaagsland was just the name of the farm
they lived on, whether as owners or hired hands. So if a guy moved this
third name would change. It really wasn't until the 20th century that
last names started to be used to follow patrimony over multiple
generations. There are people in Norway who use the name Vaagsland
today, but this doesn't necessarily imply that we are biologically
related. In another decade or two genetic testing out to be cheap enough
to be able to definitively answer such questions. However, other
Scandinavian countries Iceland and Denmark have sequenced the genes of
large parts of the population, so Norway may decide to do this as well.
Unfortunately for genealogical research (but fortunately for privacy)
this data is
 blinded, but there may be a sunset on the blinding like there is with
census data.
<p>

<p>
I don't know. They may be at least distantly related. There were so many
groups that migrated at different times.
<p>

<p>
If I remember correctly, Vaagsland is up the valley on that map. I'm
also working with a Norwegian from Bergen now, and he says they are all
still peasants down in Telemark.

Amen. It seems also to be a summer activity. I have also been contacted
by two other relatives who discovered wogsland.org, one of whom is your
great-grandmother Mabel's nephew. His name is Arnold Wogsland

Hey there,<br>
I got a call a week or so ago from a relative who lives in california,
who knows you and says he has info on Oletta.
He's had a hard time getting e-mails to me for some reason and he called
but I was at the lumber yard so couldn't talk and now don't know how to
reach him or even his name.
Does any of this ring a bell? Maybe his name was Arnold?
I'd like to try to e-mail him if possible. Can you can help?

We had a blast hanging out with your family this summer. Are you guys

Hiya Jewelie,
<p>
His name is Arnold Wogsland and his email address is awogsland@starstream.net and I think his phone number is (916) 435-9517 <i>(from Yahoo people)</i>. He sends email with the messages as a Microsoft works doc with the extension .wpd which is readable by MSWord, Open Office, etc - but some computers don't automatically recognize it.  Arnold lives in Rocklin, a suburb of Sacramento, and actually worked with my aunt at the DoD back in the 80s.  I am planning to meet him later this month.
<p>
He is actually more closely related to you than me:<br>

Thanks.<br>
I have been on your site obsessively and see that I left out one of my
dad's many names: Lewis.
His full name is Benny Gilbert Lewis Andrew Alvin Randall.
If possible I'd love to have a better pic of Andy online. He's not super
photogenic.<br>
I am writing to Arnold now.

I guess I sent the other e-mail too soon.
Here is info on Grandpa Virgil that is missing from the site:
U.S. Social Security Death Index *1.* Virgil GRATIAS
<http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/search/SSDI/individual_record.asp?recid=399107156&lds=3&region=-1&regionfriendly=&frompage=99>
- U.S. Social Security Death Index
Birth: 23 Jun 1913  State Where Number was Issued: Wisconsin  Death: 13
Dec 2003<br>
another clarification:
Uncle Butch is a Gratias, although his father was Luthner, He must have
taken Virgil's name when my Grandma re-married.
I know you're busy and I have no need to have things updated soon, I
just do this genealogy stuff in fits and starts and thought I'd send
what I have.
thanks

I'd be happy to put a new picture of Andy up, but the one you sent me  only includes 1/2 his head.
