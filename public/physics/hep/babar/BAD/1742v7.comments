Why is Fig 1, mentioned in paragraph 1, on page 2?

Why are these decays being looked for if theory predicts they 3 orders of magnitude beyond our current dataset?

Are there any other models which could be used to generate signal MC, and, if so, why aren't they also considered?

In Paragraph 3 on page 2, your cuts seem like a rather arbitrary way to eliminate the signal. How can your justify the reported upper bound in light of these cuts? What was the procedure used to determine them? When the signal was gone?
